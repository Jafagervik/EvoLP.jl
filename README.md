# EvoLP - an evolutionary computation playground

A framework for _playing around_ with evolutionary computation. This is not meant to replace packages like `Evolutionary` or `Metaheuristics`. Instead, the aim is to provide a common ground of utilities for analysis and measurement.

This is meant to be a package at some point in the future, probably with an interface with such packages or MLJ and such.

The idea is to also implement some conversion so that IOHprofiler can be used. We'll see.
