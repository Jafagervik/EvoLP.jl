# EvoLP - an evolutionary computation playground

A framework for _playing around_ with evolutionary computation. This is not meant to replace any package like `Evolutionary` or `Metaheuristics`. Instead, the aim _was_ to provide a common ground of utilities for both analysis and measurement.

This _was_ meant to be a package at some point in the past, but now it is a place to do my experimentation and I don't know, just carry on whatever I feel like doing for evolutionary computation, I guess?

There was also an intention of creating an output compatible with IOHProfiler but it is way too expensive and I have very limited time.
Instead, I'll continue working on my stuff and see what we come up with.
