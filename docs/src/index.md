# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for EvoLP!

## What is EvoLP?

[EvoLP](https://github.com/ntnu-ai-lab/EvoLP) is a _playground_ for [evolutionary computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation) in [Julia](https://julialang.org). It provides a set of predefined _building blocks_ that can be coupled together to quickly generate evolutionary computation solvers and compute statistics for a variety of optimisation tasks, including discrete, continuous and combinatorial optimisation.

### Features

- Random [population generators](man/generators.md) (vectors and particles)
- Parent [selection operators](man/selection.md)
- Several [crossover](man/cross.md) and [mutation](man/mutation.md) methods
- [Test functions](man/benchmarks.md) for benchmarking
- Convenient [result reporting](man/results.md) and a [statistics logbook](man/logbook.md)

Combine these blocks to make your own algorithms or use some of the included: GA, 1+1EA and PSO.
Additionally, you can extend EvoLP to create new operators.
