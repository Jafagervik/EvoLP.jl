# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for EvoLP!

## What is EvoLP?

[EvoLP](https://github.com/ntnu-ai-lab/EvoLP) is a _playground_ for [evolutionary computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation) in [Julia](https://julialang.org). It provides a set of predefined _building blocks_ that can be coupled together to quickly generate solvers and compute statistics for a variety of optimisation problems, including discrete, continuous and combinatorial optimisation.
